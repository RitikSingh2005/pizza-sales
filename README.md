# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis (Pizza Hut SQL Project)
# 📌 Project Description

This project is a SQL-based data analysis project built using Pizza Hut sales data.
The aim of this project is to analyze customer orders, pizza sales, revenue, and trends using structured SQL queries.
The project simulates a real-world restaurant database, helping to understand how SQL is used in business environments to make data-driven decisions.

# 📂 Dataset Information

The project uses multiple CSV files representing different entities of a pizza ordering system:

pizzas.csv -->Contains pizza-level data such as pizza ID, size, price, and pizza type ID.

pizza_types.csv-->Stores pizza names, categories (Veg / Non-Veg), and ingredients.

orders.csv-->Contains order details including order ID, order date, and order time.

order_details.csv-->Holds transactional data such as pizza ID and quantity ordered per order.

pizzahut_project.sql-->Includes database creation, table structure, data insertion, and analysis queries.
